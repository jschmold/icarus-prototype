Crafting

- The ability to draw from any EntityPool
- The ability to add any EntityPool to draw from
- Take a specified amount of time (frames? actual time? calculate finish time in separate thread?)
- To indicate # of Entity consumed (# / Max Oxygen, list of pools?)


Representing this as an active task consuming a slot in a bay? Last time I used timeouts and async,
not exactly possible this time

Separate concerns:
  - The actual delay
  - the consumption of resources
  - the return of new resources
